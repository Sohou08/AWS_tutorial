Lambda are differents languages Python, java , Ruby , C# and PowerShell.

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, 
train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step 
of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models.

In this work, we will look at Notebook

Create a Notebook
Create a role from the service that you manage --> Here there is Sagemaker
Clone the gitlab of Julien Simon : https://gitlab.com/juliensimon/dlnotebooks/tree/master/keras/03-fashion-mnist-sagemaker

If it's not work. That possible to do it manually by upload the files.
After the Creation , open Jupiter Notebook

Open this file : Fashion MNIST-SageMaker.ipynb

Note: To get the category of fashion --> research in Internet Fashion mnist

If you want how used Keras --> this is the code that you need : mnist_keras_tf.py

And so on You can train modeel , save it ,and stop the machine 

You can build many services in AWS.

AWS don't save the actual face but the value of the function use to recognize the face
